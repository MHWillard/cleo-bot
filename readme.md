# Cleopatra 2525 Countdown Bot
This is a simple bot I wrote for my personal 100 Days of Code project. It took me a little over a week to whip up, but it taught me more about using Node and working with APIs. In this case, this bot communicates with the Twitter API and posts a simple countdown of today's date until 01/01/2525, and for fun, posts a link to the Cleopatra 2525 theme song. (It's very catchy.) I also assigned it to a Heroku dyno and used Heroku Scheulder to run it every day. Not super complex, but it taught me some good practical applications of working with Node, and I feel like it can easily be extended.
